# New Student Orientation

## Instructions

*Some new students have arrived at UR and they need your help navigating the campus! They each have a different request.* 

* For each question, start your navigation from the main [campus](/campus/) folder given in the repository. 
* **List the set of commands you used to answer their question. Do not give the name of the file as the answer!** Use block quotes (three tildas [~]) to write large segments of code as your answer. See the example below:
    
    - Q0. 
        *"Can you show me where the textbook on C++ is and what's in it?"*

        **Answer:**
        ``` 
            cd library/second_floor
            cat 'cplusplus_textbook.pdf'
        ```

* Answer the questions as you go along and use the UNIX commands list from the slides for help
* You are also free to search the internet for more commands, but cite your sources by posting a link if you do!

* You can complete this assignment by yourself or with ONE other person!
